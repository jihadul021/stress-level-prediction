# Student Stress Level Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict the stress levels of students based on various factors such as academic performance, sleep quality, extracurricular activities, depression and more. The model aims to help identify students who might be under significant stress, providing insights that can assist in creating a supportive environment for student well-being.

### Models Used:
The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated for predicting the stress level:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Random Forest**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

## Project Overview

Stress is a common issue faced by students, and it can significantly affect their academic performance and mental health. By analyzing various factors that contribute to stress, this machine learning model provides predictions that can be used to assist in early detection and intervention.

### Features:
- Prediction of stress level based on multiple student-related factors.
- Helps in identifying students who may need support or intervention.
- Can be used by educational institutions for well-being initiatives.
